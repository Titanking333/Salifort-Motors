# **Capstone Project: Employee Retention at Salifort Motors**

## **📌 Project Overview**
Salifort Motors, a leading alternative energy vehicle manufacturer, is experiencing **high employee turnover**.
This project aims to analyze the factors contributing to attrition and develop a **predictive model** to help the company retain valuable employees.

## **📊 Objectives**
- Identify key factors leading to employee turnover.
- Build a **machine learning model** to predict employees likely to leave.
- Provide **data-driven recommendations** to improve retention rates.

## **🛠️ Data & Methodology**
### **🔹 Dataset**
The dataset includes employee details such as:
- **Department**
- **Salary Level**
- **Number of Projects**
- **Average Monthly Hours Worked**
- **Employee Satisfaction Score**
- **Attrition Status (Left or Stayed)**

### **🔹 Data Processing & EDA**
- **Handled Missing Values & Duplicates**
- **Explored Data Trends & Visualizations**
- **Detected Outliers (Boxplots, Histograms)**
- **Feature Correlations (Heatmaps)**

### **🔹 Machine Learning Models Used**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier(Best Performing Model)**


## **📈 Key Insights & Findings**
- Employees with **low salaries & high workloads** have **higher turnover rates**.
- Some departments face **more attrition than others**.
- Employees working **excessive hours on multiple projects** are **more likely to leave**.
- The **Random Forest Classifier (2nd model) performed best** in predicting at-risk employees.

## **🏆 Business Recommendations**
- **Balance workload** to prevent burnout.
- **Increase salaries & incentives** for high-risk departments.
- Use the **predictive model** to proactively engage at-risk employees.
